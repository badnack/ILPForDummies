\section{About}
The purpose of this document is to present Intuitionistic Logic as descriptive
programming language. The main goal is to
have a self-contained paper: a reader should be able to understand its content
even though his (or her) background on formal logic is limited or inexistent.

This paper is structured as follows: in Section~\ref{sec:terms} a glossary of the
technical terms that will be used throughout this document is presented, in Section~\ref{sec:lfhr}
are reported some simple examples which show what is
hypothetical reasoning, Section~\ref{sec:il} provides an overview of intuitionistic
logic, Section~\ref{sec:formalization} explains how hypothetical reasoning can be
represented in intuitionistic logic and finally Section~\ref{sec:ilp} treats
intuitionistic logic as descriptive language and how an interpreter
for hypothetical reasoning can be written.
